A student passionate about learning web and mobile development.

I'm currently studying ReactJS and Node.js technologies to create nice, beautiful and accessible websites.

My goal is to work in the development area using the technologies and knowledge I learned in order to help as many people as possible, solving their problems through lines of code.
